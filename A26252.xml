            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In the next place, I am to conſider his <hi>Lordſhips Stile,</hi> which in Latin is <hi>Seneſchallus Angliae,</hi> and his <hi>Court</hi> is Intituled, <hi>Placita Coronae coram Seneſchallo Angliae;</hi> and when he ſitteth by force of his Office, he ſitteth under a Cloth of Eſtate, and ſuch as direct themſelves to him, ſay,<note place="margin">Co. <hi>4.</hi> Inſt. <hi>59.</hi>

               <hi>Pleaſe your Grace, my Lod High-Steward of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Antiquity of the Office,</hi> 'tis very ancient, and was before the Conqueſt: For Sir <hi>Ed. Coke</hi> tells us, that he himſelf hath read an Authentical Manuſcript, intituled, <hi>Authoritas Seneſchalli Anglia;</hi> which putting an Example of his Authority, ſaith, <hi>Sicut accidit</hi> God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wino, <hi>Comiti Kanciae, tempore Regis</hi> Edwardi, <hi>Anteceſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> Willielmi <hi>Ducis</hi> Normandiae, <hi>pro hujuſmodi male ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtis, &amp; conſiliis ſuis, per Seneſchallum Angliae adjudicatus, &amp; fortis fecit Comitivam ſuam.</hi> In the time of <hi>William the Conquerour, William Fitz-Euſtace</hi> was Steward of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next come we to conſider, how this Great Office was formerly holden, and how at this time.</p>
            <p>This Magiſtracy was formerly of Inheritance, and belonged to the Earldome of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> as appeareth by a Record produced by Sir <hi>Ed. Coke; Seneſchalcia Angliae pertinet ad Comitivam de</hi> Leiceſter, <hi>&amp; pertinuit ab an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Other Records teſtifie, that it belong'd to the Barony of <hi>Hinckley;</hi> and my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> tells us; that in the Reign of <hi>William Rufus,</hi> and <hi>H.</hi> 1. <hi>Hagh Grant ſemenel,</hi> Baron of <hi>Hinckley,</hi> held that Barony by the ſaid Office;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42600:4"/>ſo that there ſeems a diverſity between theſe Records; but we ſhall reconcile it thus: <hi>Hinckley</hi> was parcel of the Poſſeſſions of the E. of <hi>Leiceſter;</hi> for <hi>Robert Bella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> E. of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>H.</hi> 2. married with <hi>Petronil,</hi> Daughter and Heir of the ſaid <hi>Hugh Grantſemenel,</hi> Baron of <hi>Hinckley,</hi> and Lord Steward of <hi>England;</hi> and ſo it continued, till by the forfeiture of <hi>Simon Montford</hi> it came to King <hi>H.</hi> 3. who in the fiftieth year of his Reign created <hi>Edmond</hi> his ſecond Son Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> Baron of <hi>Hinckley,</hi> and High-Steward of <hi>England;</hi> which continued in his Line, until <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bullingbrook,</hi> Son and Heir of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> who was the laſt that had any Eſtate of Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance in the Office of the Steward of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since the time of <hi>H.</hi> of <hi>Bullingbrook,</hi> this great Office was never granted to any Subject, but only <hi>hac Vice:</hi> and the reaſon was, for that the Power of this Officer is ſo tranſcendent, that it was not holden fit to be in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Subjects hands: For a Record ſaith, <hi>Et ſciendum eſt quod ej us Officium eſt ſupervidere &amp; regnare ſub Rege, &amp; immediate poſt Regem totum Regnum Angliae, &amp; omnes Miniſtros Legum infra idem Regnum, temporibus pacis &amp; guerrarum, &amp;c.</hi> and proceedeth particularly with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers high Powers and Authorities.</p>

            <p>At the day, the Lord High-Steward, with ſix Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants at Arms before him, takes his place under a Cloth of Eſtate, and then the Clerk of the Crown delivers to him his Commiſſion, who re-delivers it. After three <hi>O Yes</hi>'s by a Serjeant at Arms, and Commandment given in the Name of the Lord High-Steward of <hi>England</hi> to keep ſilence, the Commiſſion is read; then the Uſher delivers to the Steward a white Rod, who re-delivers the ſame, which he holds before the Lord High-Steward.

               <hi>O Yes</hi> being again made, Commandment is given in the Name of the H.

            <p>When they have taken their places, and the Priſoner ſet to the Bar, then the Lord High-Steward delcares un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the cauſe of their Aſſembly, and perſwades the Priſoner to Anſwer without fear, aſſuring him, that he ſhall be heard with patience, and that Juſtice ſhall be done to him.</p>

            <p>After this, the Clerk of the Crown reads the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and proceeds to the Arraignment of the Priſoner; and if he plead <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> the Entry is, <hi>Et de hoc de bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no &amp; malo ponit ſe ſuper Pares ſuos, &amp;c.</hi> After which the Lord High-Steward gives a Charge to the Peers, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting them to try the Priſoner indifferently, according to their Evidence, which is opened by the King's Learned Counſel, who produce their Proofs for the King againſt the Priſoner. Soe, or all of the Judges, are ever attendant upon the Lord High-Seward, and take their places at the feet of the Peers.</p>
            <p>After the Evidence is given for the King, and the Priſoners Defence made, he is withdrawn from the Bar, under the cuſtody of the Lieutenant, whilſt the Tryers go to ſome place to conſider of their Evidence; upon debate of which, if they doubt of any matter, they cannot ſend to the High-Steward to ask the Judges any Queſtions of Law, but in the hearing of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, that he may know whether the caſe be rightly put, for <hi>de facto jus Oritur;</hi> neither can they ſend for the Judges to know their Opinion, but the H.

            <p>When the Lords are agreed, they return into Court, and the Lord H. S. publickly in open Court, beginning with the Puiſny Lod, ſays unto him, <hi>My Lord</hi> A. <hi>is</hi> W. v.

            </p>
            <p>The Peers having given their Verdict in the abſence of the Priſoner, the Priſoner is brought to the Bar, whom the Lord High-Steward acquaints with the Verdict of his Peers, and gives Judgment accordingly, either of Condemnation, or Acquittal.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:42600:7"/>
            <p>After the Service is performed, and <hi>O Yes</hi> made for diſſolving the Commiſſion, the white Rod is taken by the Lord High-Steward in both his hands, and broken in pieces.</p>

            <p>Every Lord of Parliament that hath Voice therein, and called thereto by the King's Writ, ſhall not be tryed by Peers, but only ſuch as ſit <hi>Patrone Nobilitatis;</hi> as Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earls, Viſcounts, and Barons, and not ſuch as are Lords of Parliament, by reaſon of their Baronies which they hold in right of the Church, as Arch-Biſhops, and Biſhops of this Realm; for though they be Lords of Parliament, yet upon an Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment either of Treaſon or Felony, they ſhall not be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Peers of the Realm, but by a Jury of Knights, and other ſubſtantial perſons pon their Oaths; and one reaſon alledged by ſome (how truly let others judge) is, foraſmuch as Archbiſhops and Biſhops cannot paſs in like caſes upon the tryal of any other of the Peers, their Lordſhips being prohibited by the Common and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Laws to be Judges of Life and Death; and this Tryal ought to be Mutual, ſince the performance of it is upon their Honours, without any Oath taken.</p>

            <p>No Temporal Lord, but only Lords of Parliament, ſhall have this kind of Tryal; and therefore the Eldeſt Son, and Heir Apparent of a Duke, in the life of his Father, though he be called an Earl, is excluded: And this was the Caſe of <hi>Henry Howard,</hi> Earl of <hi>Surrey,</hi> Son and Heir Apparent of <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> in the 38. of <hi>H.</hi> 8.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42600:17"/>remov'd their Quarters, to the end that they might avoid giving offence; but yet he preſſes them to bear a part in this Diabolical ſervice, and upon their humble refuſal puts them forthwith to a <hi>Decima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which they chearfully ſubmit unto, praying fur their Murtherers: The <hi>Tyrant</hi> would not yet be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, but renew'd his Commands to the Remainder of them, and finding them ſtill to continue Reſolute rather to die than to diſobey God, he butcher'd them all, without the leaſt Reſiſtance on their part. This was truly to <hi>Confeſs</hi> him that was led as a ſheep to the Slaughter! Nay ſo very Fruitful are the Antient <hi>Fathers</hi> in <hi>Inſtances</hi> of this quality, that it would be but Superfluous to recount any more of them; the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Practice of the Primitive Chriſtians being ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident in this point, that the greateſt <hi>Sticklers</hi> for that <hi>ſin of Witchcraft, Rebellion,</hi> have not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to deny it.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That a <hi>Liberty</hi> to <hi>Reſiſt</hi> thoſe in whom the <hi>Law</hi> has plac'd <hi>the Power of the Sword</hi> is Repugnant to <hi>Sound Reaſon, I</hi> ſhall endeavour to make out by the following Arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Such a <hi>Licenſe</hi> to Subjects againſt their Rulers, is deſtructive of the very Nature of <hi>Government,</hi> and of <hi>Humane Society;</hi> for it diſſolves the ſinews of the <hi>State,</hi> and ſplits it into as many. Factions as it has Enemies. And it is impoſſible to conceive <hi>Two</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual <hi>Supremacies</hi> of Power in the <hi>Nation,</hi> and yet the <hi>Kingdome</hi> to remaine <hi>One.</hi> For this it is that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes <hi>England, France, Spain,</hi> and all other <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Kingdomes</hi> one from another. But then it is Childiſh to Fancy the <hi>Policy</hi> of any Monarchy (much
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42600:18"/>leſs of our own) to be ſo groſly defective, as to be the Author of its own ruine, by dividing the <hi>State</hi> Legally againſt it ſelf. So that to take up Arms without or againſt <hi>Authority,</hi> is down right <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> and the Conſequence <hi>Murther</hi> and <hi>Rapine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is both Reaſonable, and neceſſary, that all <hi>Governments</hi> ſhould have a Supereminent, Coercive <hi>Power</hi> over <hi>Particular</hi> Perſons; for otherwiſe a <hi>City</hi> would immediately be hurry'd into an <hi>Anarchy,</hi> and that which ought to be <hi>One</hi> Entire Body, become ſo many <hi>Independnet</hi> men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That which to <hi>One Private</hi> Perſon is due, as a <hi>Man,</hi> the ſame is alſo due to <hi>Another;</hi> and if <hi>I</hi> may aſſume to my ſelf a power of judging when to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt</hi> my <hi>Prince,</hi> every private man may do ſo too. Now what Peace, what <hi>Society</hi> can there be hop'd for, where every one is at freedom to diſcharge himſelf from the Obligation of all <hi>Humane Laws,</hi> and to oppoſe them at pleaſure? Or what <hi>Obedience</hi> can conſiſt with ſuch <hi>Reſiſtance?</hi> Nor will ſuch <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines</hi> know where to ſtop; for it is uſual for them to fall foul upon all ſuch as have a deeper ſenſe of <hi>Honeſty</hi> and <hi>Allegiance</hi> than themſelves. And what <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Man</hi> was ever heard of, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd of my Murthering, a Loyal man becuaſe I my ſelf am a <hi>Rebel?</hi> Beſide that this Lewd <hi>Opinion</hi> Equally wounds the very <hi>Aſſertors</hi> of it; for any body may be allow'd to do That to <hi>Them,</hi> which they have done to their Rightful Prince and his Faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Now Touching the <hi>Muncipal Laws</hi> of the <hi>Land;</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:42600:18"/>that this <hi>Reſiſtance</hi> is againſt <hi>Them,</hi> I ſhall make it E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident. <hi>Bracton</hi> ſays, <hi>Si ab eo (ſcil.
